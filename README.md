<h1 align="center">Portal 2 RTX Remix Compatibility Mod</h1>

<div align="center" markdown="1"> 

This client modification is specifically made for nvidia's [rtx-remix](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix).  
How does a shader based game work with remix? By manually reimplementing fixed function rendering :)

__WIP__ & __Please Note:__  
RTX Remix was never intented to support Portal 2.  
If you encounter crashes, broken things or similar, it's either due to incompatibility,  
the limits of fixed function rendering or due to bugs in the compatibility mod itself.  


### This is not trying to be a remaster.
It simply makes the game compatible with RTX Remix.  
Please keep that in mind.

## Installation / Usage
- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx/releases) and follow instructions found __there__.

<br>

#### ✳️ Info: 
- Take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx/wiki/Compatibility-Mod-Feature-Guide) for in-depth guides on features that come with the compatibility mod 🍓
  
- Current releases ship with:
  - [custom build of the remix-dxvk runtime](https://github.com/xoxor4d/dxvk-remix/tree/game/p2) which includes necessary changes  
for Portal 2
 
- Some engine tweaks that are required to make the game compatible result in CPU bottlenecks on some maps (software skinning instead of HW skinning). This may or may not improve in future updates.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting (click to expand):

<details><summary>Do I need to start the game via the batch file every time?</summary>
<br>

	Yes. Asiloaders / dxwrapper will not load if the game is run from steam.

<br></details>


<details><summary>How do I disable remix?</summary>
<br>

	Run `p2-rtx-disable.bat` and follow the instructions to disable or the mod.  
	The game will start afterwards to reset some required cvars.

<br></details>


<details><summary>Crashing, startup issues, not working ..</summary>
<br>

- Make sure that you have no clipping software such as "medal" running in the background.  
- If your game is installed within `Program Files`:  
	  - right click `portal2.exe` and click settings - compatibility tab and enable run as admin  
	  - or install the game somewhere outside `Program Files`  
	
- Download and install [DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/download/details.aspx?id=8109)

<br></details>


<details><summary>Portals not showing up - Game is too dark</summary>
<br>

Make sure that you installed the [base-remix-mod](https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx-base-mod) via the installer or manually.  
Some maps are not yet touched up, so if you are not rocking an additional community mod (for remix), some maps will be dark and water broken.

<br></details>


<details><summary>No sound</summary>
<br>

- Either copy `_master.cache` from `root/portal2/maps/soundcache` to `root/portal2_dlc3/maps/soundcache`  
  or paste this into the in-game console and execute: `snd_rebuildaudiocache;snd_updateaudiocache;exit`
