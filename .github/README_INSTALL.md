# Installation:

### Install using the installer:
1. Download <LINK_TO_MOD_ZIP>
2. Download <LINK_TO_INSTALLER>

3. Place both files in the same folder (_no need to copy them to your game folder_) and run `Portal2-Remix-CompMod-Installer.exe` 
4. Use the File Dialog to select your `portal2.exe` which is located in your Portal2 install folder


<br>

### OR Install manually (no need to do this if you've used the installer):
1. Download <LINK_TO_MOD_ZIP>

2. Open the zip and extract all files contained inside the `Portal2-Remix-CompatibilityMod` folder into your Portal2 directory (next to the `portal2.exe`). Overwrite all when prompted.

3. Download the [`base remix-mod`](https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx-base-mod/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) - repo: (https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx-base-mod)
4. Extract and place the `mods` folder __into__ the `rtx-remix` folder found in the Portal 2 __root__ folder  
(create the `rtx-remix` folder if it does not exist) (see [this](#folder-structure))

> [!Note]
> Only maps up until Act 2 (catapult intro) are touched up. Other maps might look weird / dark. That also includes water surfaces.
> I suggest grabbing [Digital Additions](https://www.moddb.com/mods/digital-additions) which overhauls basically the entire game.

## ✳️ Info:
- Current releases ship with a custom build of the [remix-dxvk runtime](https://github.com/xoxor4d/dxvk-remix/tree/game/p2_rebase3) including necessary changes for Portal 2
- Some engine tweaks required to make the game compatible with RTX Remix result in CPU bottlenecks on some maps (software skinning instead of HW skinning, drawcall amount). This may or may not improve in future updates.
- There are clever ways to optimize many aspects of this game but that takes time and lots of effort.
